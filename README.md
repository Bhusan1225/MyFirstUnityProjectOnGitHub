Assignment 5 - Setting up Unity Project on Git
[Task - Cloning]

Create New empty repository on GitHub named as MyFirstUnityProjectOnGitHub
Do not forget to add the readme file and Unity gitignore file to your new repository while creating the repository.
Clone the newly created repository into your local PC using the source tree/any other tool.
Select a location where you want to clone, the example you have cloned the empty repository into a folder named Myfolder.
[Task - Setting Up Unity Project on Cloned Repository]

After cloning your empty repository you will see a folder on your decided location.
Now create a new project into Unity into that cloned folder, for example, Myfolder.
Once the project is created into the cloned folder you will see some changes in your source tree/any tool but as we have added the Unity gitignore, the count for changes will be lower.
Now make any changes in your scene of Unity and commit that scene.
After commit, push your changes.
